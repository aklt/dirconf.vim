*dirconf.txt*                Per project configuration                  v0.1.0
==============================================================================

This plugin is for managing project specific vim config and notes ina
directory separate from the repo dir.     

This is done by making a file name from the path of the project and storing it
in the directory pointed to by `g:dirconf_dir`.  

TODO Later It is also possible to specify a project dir in `g:dirconf_lookup`

USAGE                                                  *dirconf*  *dirconf-usage* 

When editing a file of your project call: >
  
     :DirConf
<
to open the file with vim configuration that will be sourced whenever you edit
a file in this project.  The name of this file can be set in: >
     
     let g:dirconf_vimfile = 'conf.vim'
<
You can also open other files in the same directory location by naming the
file to edit: >
     
     :DirConf README.md
<
will open a `README.md` file in the same directory as the the vim file.  I use
this for notes about directories and it is handly to map it to a brief
shortcut: >

    nmap <LocalLeader>dc :DirConf README.md
<
                                                                *g:dirconf_dir*

All project files are stored under `g:dirconf_dir` which defaults to: >
    
    let g:dirconf_dir = $HOME . '/.vim/dirconf'
<
If the directory does not exist it is created.
                                                            *g:dirconf_verbose*

To see what happens when entering vim you can set >
     
    let g:dirconf_verbose = 1
<
which will echo the file name that is looked for.

TODO                                                             *dirconf-todo*

* find project root dir
* work on windows
