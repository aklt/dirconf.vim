                                                                     *dirconf*
This plugin is for maintaining project specific configuration and keeping
notes associated with the project.  The configuration and notes are kept
outside of the project source directory.

Usage ~

When editing a file in a project call: >

    :DirConf
<
to open the context file.  This file should contain vim configuration which
will be executed when you edit a file in this project.

You can specify a file suffix of the file to open: >

    :DirConf md
<
will open a context file with a `.md` extension instead of `.vim`.  I find it
useful to map the above commands to `:DC` and `:DD` to edit project
configuration project notes respectively: >

    nnoremap :DC :DirConf<CR>
    nnoremap :DD :DirConf md<CR>
<
                                                             *dirconf-context*
The context file ~

The context file can contain arbitrary vim configuration.  It will be
evaluated as a vim function when a file in the corresponding project is
opened.  Within it there is access to these predefined variables:

  *a:dir*    the directory where dirconf context files are stored
  *a:name*   the context file basename
  *a:file*   the context file name with `.vim` suffix

if the context file sets `reload_eagerly` to 1: >

    let reload_eagerly = 1
<
the function created from the context file will be evaluated each time the
buffer is entered.  This is useful to set global configuration variables for a
project that are different for another file in a different buffer.

                                                              *dirconf-config*
Configuration ~

The project root directory is determined by searching backwards from the file
path until one of the files in `g:dirconf_parent_files` is found.  It defaults
to: >

    let g:dirconf_parent_files = ['.git/config']
<
When one of these files is found in a directory it becomes the root directory
and all files beneath it will share the same dirconf context file.

                                                               *g:dirconf_dir*

All files edited through `:DirConf` are stored under `g:dirconf_dir` which
defaults to: >

    let g:dirconf_dir = $HOME . '/.vim/dirconf'
<
If the directory does not exist it is created.
                                                           *g:dirconf_verbose*

To see debug info you can set >

    let g:dirconf_verbose = 1
<
TODO                                                            *dirconf-todo*
